The current proposed table of contents is in the next section.  Each item will be a link to a file containing that section of the document.  

### Editing a file

To edit one of the files linked below, click the link to go to the file.  At the top of the box displaying the file, on the right hand side, will be buttons "Raw", "Blame", and "History".  To the right 
of these will be a pencil.  Click this.  This will take you to a page that will let you make edits to the file.  The files are written using the Markdown syntax, which is fairly minimal and should be 
pretty easy to imitate but which has a very short tutorial [here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
