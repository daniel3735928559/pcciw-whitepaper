The current proposed table of contents is in the next section.  Each item will be a link to a file containing that section of the document.  

#### Editing a file

To edit one of the files linked below, click the link to go to the
file.  At the top of the box displaying the file, on the right hand
side, will be buttons "Raw", "Blame", and "History".  To the right of
these will be a pencil.  Click this.  This will take you to a page
that will let you make edits to the file.  The files are written using
the Markdown syntax, which is fairly minimal and should be pretty easy
to imitate.  If you don't see a which has a very short tutorial
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).

Once you are happy with your changes, at the bottom of that page you
may preview your changes and provide a small summary of what you
changed, for example "corrected misspellings" or "added a paragraph
about African Grey Parrots".  If there was anything you didn't figure
out how to do with regard to formatting, feel free to include that as
well.  Finally, also at the bottom of the screen is a button to submit
your changes.

You may perform this procedure on file, in addition, in order to edit
the table of contents below.
